merrytimes visualization for governor's island holocenter install

## How to build

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt --debug
```

## Guidelines
* images (historical) swell and move according to ship rate
* save imgs as pngs in publi/img folder (lowcase, hyphens)
* will batch process at B/W in css
* background parallax will be either panorama of island view or flattened silhouette
* OBJECTIVE: build a pictorial clock (something that shows how network activity and travel are relative to your postion...in this case, a tempo/spatial warp in an island interior)

## Prep
###Questions for Visit
** Ask these: **
* Does the venue have wifi?
	* Yes, but isn't that reliable. SSID WIFIRSU 884A886C
* How many outlets are there?
	* Two, bring adaptor probably
* What resolution is the projector? How many projectors do we have (same make/model?)?
	* Two projectors, unsure of resolution, need to email to check with Carlton who can give more details
	* Also there are polarising lenses and 3D glasses available if we want to attempt something with them
* Access to historical assets or resources, any recommendations?
	* Email for details
* What will the audience be like for the duration of our residency?
	* General public, people stay about 10 - 30 seconds...
* How long will the application be "up" (both duration of the residency and runtime of the app)?
	* Sat & Sun only, we need to have it ready before that, can take down ASAP after
* How much of our own hardware will we have to provide (computer? macmini?)?
	* Provide computer. Speaker provided
* Do we need to make title/artist labels? What can we mount/paste/attach to the walls?
	* Email abstract of piece in advance and Jonah will print it out
* Is there anyone available when we install to help with technical/insfrastructure/mounting issues? Is there a ladder? Can we run cables?
	* Jonah should be about when we install and can help out. We probably won't need to to run cables or use ladders or anything.
* Can we be provided with pictures/CAD drawings?
	* Nope
* When is "take-down"? What is the general timeline?
	* I guess either during the week or perhaps we do it late on Sunday.

** Consider the install atmosphere: **
* What is the light quality, take a look at how the projector displays something from the web if you can (how does it look versus something on your phone...will our projection be tinted?)? Will it run only daytime (full-light)
	* The room has no windows and is fairly dark. The door has a half curtain and the hallway outside is quite bright. There were two velvet chairs in the room when I visited, unsure if they will stay. People can do walk in front of the projectors which are mounted on a rack on the floor.
* What is the room layout (draw a sketch, take pictures)
	* About 16ft square. Sketch in notebook
* What image size are we shooting for?
	screen is approx 10ft x 5ft
* Will shadows be an issue, will the audience block projections at any point, if so, can we use this to our advantage?
	Yes, people will be walking in front of the projections.

### Don't forget
* Take pictures of the space, measure if possible (even with feet, we can measure your foot and counts later if you don't have a tape measure)
* Try for a panorama image around the island
	* Attempted lots of shops that can be stitched in to a rough panorama. In dropbox awaiting stitching. Also added quite a few objects which could be cut out to use in the foreground.

### Other notes
* We have two staff passes that let us on the early morning ferries 6am-6pm, but they *only run from Manhattan on weekdays*. Passes are valid from May 18 to Aug 18

### Questions Post-visit
* Visualize piece in the space and imagine issues that might pop up (are you installing something with sound in a loud space, somethingwith a projector in a bright space, trying to interact with people who do not want to interact with you, are there kids running around, etc.)
* Don't make any assumptions about who is responsible for anything; be prepared to do everything
* Can we set everything up so that this works
