Holocenter Install Plan
=========
##IDEAS
*   ships to/from governor's island; pacing of the ships moves projection objects; audio input influenced by attendance/audience and their interaction with the interior environment

###MERRYTIMES

Previously, travel to island locales has depended on modes of maritime transportation; contemporary connectivity relies moreso on modes of communication (network activity, simple syndication) as forms of transporation to insular environments. We can navigate to Governor's Island without physical displacement, however the alternative of actual movement is still possible. Merry-times comments on this contemporary phenomenon of circumstantial telepresence, honoring visitor traffic past and present.

Our installation combines historical and contemporary modes of movement, visualizing and auralizing networked traffic between islands and internet zones. Parallax projections visualize real-time ferry traffic as moving imagery in a maritime-military decopage motif; meanwhile, ambient sounds synced to audience network activity as attendees enter and exit provide a sense of dual parallax and human presence. When remote *distance* can collapse into *instants* of interconnectivity; our understanding of temporal and spacial insularity warps; Merrytimes invites viewers to interact with, and immerse themselves in this sense of simultaneous position, presence, and parallax displacement.


Merry Times (revised)

Historically, Governor's Island provided a site to stage international events and military presence. Presently, it hosts domestic events in the public service. As an installation, Merry Times plays with the island's mutable purpose, providing an idealized panoramic view from a patchwork of maritime imagery and sounds. Blending layers of decopaged images and a glossing pattern, the projections pull from hyperlocal images, mathematical periodicity and the puzzled patternmaking of truchet tiling, alluding to the layered craft of composing history relative to place, where no snapshot view is ever identical to precedent. It applies photo, pattern, and parallax to a scene that swoons and swells with the passage of time, and invites the viewer to witness that pendulum progression around the island from a paradoxically static position.

Acknowledging the timelessness of an island with layered history, MerryTimes invites viewers to immerse themselves in this sense of simultaneous position, presence, and parallax displacement.



## STYLE
* rough cutout aesthetic
* contemporary
* evocative of Peter Blake's and maritime military decopage style

## TECH SPECS
We will provide a laptop with projection-worthy web-view; we'll also have an accompanying web-version of the installation.
We will require two projectors.
